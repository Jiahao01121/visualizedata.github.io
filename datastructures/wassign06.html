    	<h2>Weekly Assignment 6</h2>
    	<h3>Due 10/17 at 4:00pm</h3>

        <p>You're going to continue working with the AA data you scraped, parsed, and augmented. You will continue to clean the "raw" data as you encounter its errors and limitations. As your cleaning tasks become more complex, they should be dealt with inside functions. For example:</p>

        <h4>A function that takes a meeting name from your web scrape and returns a cleanly formatted meeting name. The function should:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove redundancies.</li>
                <li>Remove unnecessary punctuation, such as parentheses, hyphens, redundant commas, and symbols.</li>
                <li>Correct misspellings.</li>
                <li>Example: "LIVING NOW - Living Now (:II)" should be "LIVING NOW"</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>A function that takes address data from your web scrape and returns a formatted address that is appropriate for input to the Google Geocoding API. The function should:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove unnecessary address elements such as floor, room number, or directions.</li>
                <li>Remove unnecessary punctuation, such as parentheses, hyphens, redundant commas, and symbols.</li>
                <li>Correct misspellings.</li>
            </ol>
