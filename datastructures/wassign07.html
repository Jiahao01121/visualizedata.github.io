        <h2>Weekly Assignment 7</h2>
        <h3>Due 10/25 at 4:00pm</h3>

        <p>Switching gears from previous assignments, you will use a microcontroller and sensors to collect and log data to your local computer. You will also design (in concept only) an interactive visualization of the data you will collect from the sensor.</p>

        <h4>Create a design PDF and upload to Canvas:</h4>
                <p>Upload a PDF of your design for an interactive visual representation of the data you will be collecting with your sensor. Can be scans of sketches, mock ups in any software, or any other way that you feel best communicates the design of an interactive visual representation of the data being generated by your sensor.</p>

        <h4>Demonstrate data values generated by your sensor:</h4>
                <p>Bring your laptop, Arduino, and sensor to class to demonstrate what it is outputting to the serial monitor. Be prepared to talk about how it connects to your design of the interactive visual representation.</p>

<h4>Submission</h4>

            <ol>

        <li>Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s).  </li>
        <li>Upload the relevant PDF file to Canvas.</li>
        <li>Bring your laptop and components to class. </li>

            </ol>
