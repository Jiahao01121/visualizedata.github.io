    	<h2>Surveys</h2>
        <p>There are <a target="_blank" href='http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/upshot/how-polling-can-go-wrong.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share'>many ways that polls and surveys can go wrong</a>. Survey methodologists <a target="_blank" href='http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/upshot/when-you-hear-the-margin-of-error-is-plus-or-minus-3-percent-think-7-instead.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share'>estimate the margin of error</a> to convey the generalizability of a survey. But they also have to <a target="_blank" href='http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/20/upshot/the-error-the-polling-world-rarely-talks-about.html?_r=0'>radically recomposition samples because they are not representative of the general population</a>. These are difficult concepts for the general public to understand. How can we better express visually the uncertainty we have about estimates from surveys?
